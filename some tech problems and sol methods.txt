1. how to build android app based on google map?

target: get location info

platform: java, android sdk, google map

1). get google map API key
2). put google map object into android 
3). add map zoom component, map mode and adjustment of scaling ratio
4). get the current location information with android location-info-service
5). show the current location as an icon/mark on the map

2. how to build android clients and servers?

target: implement communication between servers and clients

platform: 
Java
server: apache tomcat 6.X
Struts2: for JSON transformation from servers to clients
Database: 
server-side: mysql(because it's free...), more powerful one is sql server
client-side: light weight database is enough, use SQlite
JSON package

use http + jason or socket + jason to realize two basic functions:
1). clients send request to servers
2). servers return data to client

improvement:
scalability-handle high concurrency: httpSQS + simpleDB, which can handle > 10k concurrent request and database read/write.
but it is not necessary for our small-scale proj this quater...just for further improvement(like small uber...ovo)
