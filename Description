An application which responds to carpool people from their own address to UCSD campus. And the application will not earn profit, but will let the driver charge the tips for gas or parking fees, and the amount of tips will be decided either the driver or passengers.
The user register their character(driver or passenger) first, then input their basic information, like: address, gender, PID(just for the security), phone number, empty slots normally of driver’s car,  and other information as needed. There also will be a rating system for the driver and passenger to evaluate the performance,  like lateness or manner. 
The client also want a chat system in the application. Therefore nobody can see stranger’s contact information until they add each other as friends.
When the user(passenger)  trying to find a driver nearby, they can select the range (up to 5 miles) around the registered address of him. Then select the driver who also registered the address in the chosen range. After contact the driver, need a button to DEAL for both sides of passenger and driver.
